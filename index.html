        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p> This app allows an admin to manage help desk tickets that come in from Lambda School Students. </p> 
        <p>As a student you want to log in and have the ability to see tickets that are currently open for help. </p>
        <p>As a student you want to be able to create a new help ticket with a title, description, what you've tried and a category (i.e. React).</p>
